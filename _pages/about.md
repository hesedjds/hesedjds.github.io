I completed my Ph.D. in 2024, under the supervision of [Minsu Cho](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mcho) at Pohang University of Science and Technology ([POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr)) [Computer Vision Lab.](https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab), Pohang, Korea. My research interest is in computer vision and deep learning, especially scene graph generation and graph neural networks for computer vision.
